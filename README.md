**Authors**: Marvin Bonds, Riki Plaza, Faustino Marco Simpliciano

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

## Professional Pairing Practice

### Logistical
- What hours will you be available to communicate?
- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
- How often will you take breaks?
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

### Cooperative
- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to     approach the day-to-day development?

### Conflict Resolution
- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
