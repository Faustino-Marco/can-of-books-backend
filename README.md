# Can of Books

**Authors**: Marvin Bonds, Riki Plaza, Faustino Marco Simpliciano

**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates
<!-- See below -->

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->

## Professional Pairing Practice

### Logistical 
- What hours will you be available to communicate?
  - We're committed to working until midnight (local time-respectively), possibly longer if necessary.
- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Primarily slack and remo channels
- How often will you take breaks?
  - Ideally, hourly breaks, unless we're on a roll or committed to an isolated time-frame for any given individual task.
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - We'll seek the assistance of the TA's and instructor.

### Cooperative 
- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
  - Marco: back-end coding, js
  - Riki & Marvin: front-end coding
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  - We'll divide the work accordingly, with Riki and Marvin working primarily on the front-end, and Marco working primarily on the back-end.
- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Marco - needs to work on front-end
  - Riki - needs to work on back-end
  - Marvin - needs to work on back-end
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to     approach the day-to-day development?
  - We'll divide the work at the beginning of our work time and support each other.

### Conflict Resolution 
- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - We'll communicate directly with one another to be clear on our progress and reach out to TA's and instructors if necessary.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - We've discussed this already and we're confident that we're going to divide the work appropriately, given that we have three people to work with.
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - We've agreed on a general outline for how to manage the workload in a way that won't necessarily step on toes, so-to-speak. And a few of us are behind enough on our coursework that we can work on other things when our groupmates are working in the same areas.
